        About <b>Me</b> 
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate designer with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Informatics and additional qualifications as a 3D
        modeler and animation designer. I strive to create captivating designs and bring ideas to life. Precision down to
        the pixel and creative problem-solving are essential to my approach.

        My journey in design began in 2019 when I finished create an app design for my Bachelor's thesis in Applied
        Informatics and Mathematics at Saint Petersburg State University. This experience sparked my passion for design,
        and in 2020, I pursued further qualifications at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,
        specializing as an animation and 3D designer. I continued to learn independently, completing courses in After
        Effects, Illustrator, Cinema 4D, Photoshop, and Figma.

        When I'm not fully immersed in design projects, you can often find me participating in design marathons, which I
        truly enjoy. I also run a blog and work as a freelance photographer where I share insights about design and
        glimpses of my life. You can find me on YouTube and Instagram.
